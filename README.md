# Bank-Loan-Default-Prediction
#  Financial Risk Analytics

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Financial institutions face significant challenges in managing credit risk. Identifying borrowers who are likely to default on loans is crucial for reducing financial losses and improving decision-making.  

This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  techniques to predict the likelihood of loan default using historical borrower data.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Analyze borrower and loan data to identify default risk patterns.
- Provide actionable insights to help financial institutions improve credit risk assessment.

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
1. **Data Understanding & Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of borrower income, loan amount, and credit history.
   - Correlation analysis between borrower attributes and default rates.

3. **Results**
   - Identified top risk factors influencing defaults (e.g., credit history, loan amount).

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Borrowers with **poor credit history** showed significantly higher default rates.  
- **High loan-to-income ratio** strongly correlated with defaults.
